## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Sample Table 

```{r sample_table}

nrow <- 3
ncol <- 4

truth.matrix <- matrix(data = rep("Preceptor is God", nrow * ncol), nrow = nrow, ncol = ncol)

colnames(truth.matrix) <- c("Truth", "Also Truth", "Still Truth", "Incredibly, True")

gt(truth.matrix) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Truth Table",
    subtitle = "P-values 0 for all Coefficients"
  )

```

# Sample Regression Table 

```{r sample_regression, results = "asis"}

is_preceptor <- c(1, 0)
teaches_1006 <- c(1, 0)

causal_teaches_1006 <- lm(teaches_1006 ~ is_preceptor)

stargazer(causal_teaches_1006, header = FALSE, type = "latex")
```
