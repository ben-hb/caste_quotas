# Replication: Development from Representation? A Study of Quotas for Scheduled Castes in India

Since 1950, the Indian Parliament and India's state assemblies have guaranteed a minimum number of seats to Scheduled Castes (SCs). Ensuring ascriptive representation for the 16% of Indian citizens who belong to SCs was intended, in part, as a mechanism to equitably allocate resources along caste lines. To implement SC quotas, the federal government non-randomly selected constituencies in which only SC members can run for office, though all members of the constituency are allowed to vote. 

Francisca Jensenius' paper uses a dataset of constituency-level data of 3,134 state assembly constituencies from the 15 largest Indian states to compare development levels across reserved and non-reserved constituencies in 1971 and 2001. As reserved constituencies were non-randomly determined, Jensenius forms pairs of reserved and non-reserved constituencies, matching based on pre-selection characteristics to mitigate the effect of selection bias. She finds a null constituency-level effect on overall development, redistribution to SCs, literacy rates, SC employment patterns, and village amenities.
